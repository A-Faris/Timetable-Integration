# Timetable-Integration

This project allows timetables to be read and displayed on to a note-taking application called Notion. An example can be seen on this link https://www.notion.so/notiom/367ae1009e4c4cadba7eafbbacc39c39?v=c910ad29ed224715b05a9f35ef349a07

This project integrates my university timetable with Notion calendar. Notion is a note-taking application and productivity tool. Here is the link to the Notion calendar https://www.notion.so/notiom/367ae1009e4c4cadba7eafbbacc39c39?v=c910ad29ed224715b05a9f35ef349a07.

I have written down the process on how I was able to acheieve this project on Notion which can be accessed here: https://www.notion.so/notiom/Timetable-Process-593faa889c9442bda8a0aa70a6c4b280
